RazicardApp
Introduction
RazicardApp is a comprehensive Node.js application designed to streamline card management operations. Built on Ubuntu, this application leverages the power of Express.js, offering robust API endpoints for various card-related functionalities. The application is secured using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and utilizes Joi for request validation, bcrypt for password hashing, Morgan for logging, and CORS for cross-origin resource sharing.
